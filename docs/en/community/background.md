## Orchid wasn’t built overnight

When I was working at an agency, we faced a significant challenge. We admired frameworks for their power and
flexibility, but one thing kept bothering us: none of them offered a simple and user-friendly web interface for
administration.

In 2016, I was working on a large-scale travel portal. It was an ambitious project, but it gave me an opportunity:
between tasks, we started developing our own site management system on Laravel. It was our way to address the
challenge—combining ease of use and robust functionality to fill this frustrating gap.

But as time went on, it became clear that our system was too narrowly focused on specific tasks. That realization was a
turning point. In 2017, we made a bold decision: we stripped away everything unnecessary. We removed all features tied
to specific types of websites and kept only the core—a tool for building administrative interfaces that could adapt to
any application.

We found inspiration in Microsoft’s approach with Visual Studio LightSwitch, where users define screens, and the
interface is built around them. We took this idea and brought it to life on Laravel, naming our creation **Orchid**.
That’s how you know it today.

Years have passed since then. Orchid has grown and evolved, with numerous releases polishing every detail. Today, I can
confidently say this tool powers dozens of large-scale business applications. It has proven that even the most complex
problems can be solved with simplicity. Orchid isn’t just a product—it’s an idea capable of transforming how we build
interfaces.

## The Right Tool for the Right Purpose

Creating a robust graphical interface for web-based administrative applications is no small task—it’s an ambitious,
far-reaching goal. To meet such a challenge, focus is everything. Orchid is built with precision, crafted to excel in
its intended domain.

While Orchid is designed to power administrative interfaces, it’s not intended for creating marketing websites or flashy
product showcases. Instead, it’s a specialized tool, purposefully tailored to simplify and enhance the development of
back-end systems and business applications. By focusing on this niche, Orchid ensures that it delivers exactly what’s
needed for administration—nothing more, nothing less.
